A.H.B has done a great job laying my solid wood flooring from start to finish, I even had them do another job after which was to trim the bottom of my doors where I had underlay and carpet fitted.\n\n Once again being a great, clean and tidy job, I was very happy with their service, and the price given for both jobs was very reasonable. I highly recommend A.H.B if you need carpenters for flooring, sorting doors, or anything carpentry based. Give them a call, have a chat and get a quote. Very happy customer and will recommend to anyone I know that has anything needing doing. Thanks!",

The work included removing existing beading and levelling out a floor board to ensure the laminated floor was flush. A.H.B are very experienced, skilled and pleasant. We are very happy with the finished rooms and would use them again for future work.",
